<div style="text-align: justify">I first presented VGG16, VGG19, and ResNet152V2 models with parameters that can be applied to classify histopathology images via 124 training images from 23 patients. The results showed categorizing adipose, fibrous, and other tissues could even be 10% better than experienced pathologists, which is around 80%.</div>

### Codalab Competition: RoBERT for Time Expression Tasks

[![Run in Google Colab](https://img.shields.io/badge/Colab-Run_in_Google_Colab-blue?logo=Google&logoColor=FDBA18)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1FkyewiiSBLAnBOILEKG_KJF4cRSdZZ8h?usp=sharing)

<div style="text-align: justify">The release of Google's RoBERT is described as the beginning of a new era in NLP. In this notebook, I used HuggingFace's transformers library to fine-tune the pre-trained RoBERT model for a classification task. Then I combine RoBERT's performance and a baseline model. In the competition, I acquired the best accuracy for different label predictions in the dev data and 3rd in the test data. The transformers library helps us quickly and efficiently fine-tune the state-of-the-art RoBERT model and yield an accuracy rate 40% higher than the baseline model.</div>

### Detect Food Trends from Facebook Posts: Co-occurence Matrix, Lift and PPMI

[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/chriskhanhtran/facebook-detect-food-trends)

<div style="text-align: justify">First I build co-occurence matrices of ingredients from Facebook posts from 2011 to 2015. Then, to identify interesting and rare ingredient combinations that occur more than by chance, I calculate Lift and PPMI metrics. Lastly, I plot time-series data of identified trends to validate my findings. Interesting food trends have emerged from this analysis.</div>

### Detect Spam Messages: TF-IDF and Naive Bayes Classifier

<div style="text-align: justify">In order to predict whether a message is spam, first I vectorized text messages into a format that machine learning algorithms can understand using Bag-of-Word and TF-IDF. Then I trained a machine learning model to learn to discriminate between normal and spam messages. Finally, with the trained model, I classified unlabel messages into normal or spam.</div>

<!-- [![Open Notebook](https://img.shields.io/badge/Jupyter-Open_Notebook-blue?logo=Jupyter)](https://github.com/chriskhanhtran/credit-risk-prediction/blob/master/documents/Notebook.ipynb) -->
[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/peichenleegy/DiscoveryHandwashing/blob/main/Discovery_Handwashing.ipynb)

<div style="text-align: justify"> I reanalyzed the data that made Semmelweis discover the importance of <em>handwashing</em>.  Comparing the Difference in the mean monthly proportion of deaths due to handwashing. Bootstrap analysis of Semmelweis handwashing data. So, handwashing reduced the proportion of deaths by between 6.7 and 10 percentage points, according to a 95% confidence interval. All in all, it would seem that Semmelweis had solid evidence that handwashing was a highly effective procedure.</div>

### Kaggle Competition: Predict Ames House Price using Lasso, Ridge, XGBoost and LightGBM

[![Open Notebook](https://img.shields.io/badge/Jupyter-Open_Notebook-blue?logo=Jupyter)](projects/ames-house-price.html)
[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/ua-ista-457/graduate-project-pe791006ggy.git)

<div style="text-align: justify">I performed comprehensive EDA to understand important variables, handled missing values, outliers, performed feature engineering, and ensembled machine learning models to predict house prices. My best model had Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 12293.919, ranking <b>95/15502</b>, approximately <b>top 0.6%</b> in the Kaggle leaderboard.</div>
